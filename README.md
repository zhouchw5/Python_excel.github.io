# Some Basic Usages of Python in My Daily Work_(II)         
        
        
- **Still with my original insistence, your footprint in my website would not be marked or stored. I always wish a zero intersection with me after your reading, nothing but some interesting memory merely in your mind, no storage for the Like or reader amount. Your ever presence is enough.**           

In the letter _Some Basic Usages of Python in My Daily Work (I)_, we have known how Python could exchange information with an xlsx. file and some preliminary operations to edit data performed in Python. Based on these preliminary operations and some extended coding knowledge shown in this article, I would develop a simple and skeleton model to perform the decision-making process and obtain an elementary demand/supply match report.        
            
Yours,

## Our Working Schedule          
**_Working Network_**           
Our working calendar had three lines: the planning line, the ordering line and the implementing line. The planning line and the ordering line are the activating source of the whole operating process. Generally, dots linked up in planning line are the so-called planning objects. Dots linked up in sales ordering line are the Quotation Items. In actual case, planning objects would be determined in different levels of semi-products or raw materials. Conversely, the implementing line is based on the supply data of raw materials. Activated by the supply capability of raw materials, manufacturing processes of different levels of semi-products would come up with the final implementary sales plan of Quotation Items and related products.                 
         
                  
**_Working Pattern_**          
Different patterns of resource planning depend on the weights of forecast data or order data to activate the operations as the source of demand, like the pull pattern 100% from forecast data and the push pattern 100% from order data. Though in actual cases we are often oriented by the outcomes from the hedging between forecast and order, with the right mix of the pull and push patterns, I only discuss the pull pattern in this article with the activation from forecast data of parent items which we have red via Python in the (I) edition. And simply these parent items would also acts as the planning objects in our description here.           
        
        
**_Bridge Connecting the Parent Items And Son Items_**            
In the edition (I), we have imagined a black box containing all levels of semi-products to compress the 'medium' between parent items and son items. The black box is the simplified introduction in positive-direction with the forecast information of parent items (planning objects) to son items (raw materials). As we have mentioned in _Working Network_, besides the activation in positive-direction from the forecast data of parent items, We also need a reversed process from the supply information of son items

As the activating engine of our working schedule, the planning line and the ordering line are the estimated labels in front line like the navigation lighthouse.

## Summary         
This letter is not merely about some basic usages of Python. I wish to have the aid of the Python programming to perform my ever working schedule in actual scenarios, without which programming tools are no more than themselves.
