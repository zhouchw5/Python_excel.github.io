# Some Basic Usages of Python in My Daily work           
My main role in HUAWEI was a supply chain management engineer, or specifically a global master planner of IT products, to achieve the best strategy in demand fulfillment and cost control. My main job can be divided into three modules: Demand/Supply Match, Logistics Optimization and Allocations Management, all of which were mostly based on some enterprise-level planning systems like Advanced Planning System, MRP, MRP II, ERP, ISC+, etc. Though some systematic processes have been developed for our daily decision-making, some personal capabilities like programming via Python or VBA also helped simplify analysing and communicating procedures. This article would share some basic techniques in Python's interaction with Excel which I have used in some actual scenarios. Due to information security, I would only use some fictitious and simplified data for examples illustration if essential.

## Scientific Python Development Environment               
I strongly recommend that we should download the open source environment of Python, the Anaconda Navigator, which contains more than one hundred installed toolkits in Python, like numpy, pandas, os, etc.

_Spyder is a powerful integrated development environment with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging and introspection features._

## Actual Cases           
_First part for some important modules we should import before programming, like os, pandas as pd, numpy as np, and datetime._         
The os in my programme is mainly used to join selected files to the defined project path. 





``` python        
hello world

```
