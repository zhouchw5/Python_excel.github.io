- **Still with my original insistence, your footprint in my website would not be marked or stored. I always wish a zero intersection with me after your reading, nothing but some interesting memory merely in your mind, no storage for the Like or reader amount. Your ever presence is enough.**           

In the letter _Some Basic Usages of Python in My Daily Work (I)_, we have known how Python could exchange information with an xlsx. file and some preliminary operations to edit data performed in Python. Based on these preliminary operations and some extended coding knowledge shown in this article, I would develop a simple and skeleton model to perform the decision-making process and obtain an elementary demand/supply match report.
