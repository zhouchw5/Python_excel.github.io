- **Still with my original insistence, your footprint in my website would not be marked or stored. I always wish a zero intersection with me after your reading, nothing but some interesting memory merely in your mind, no storage for the Like or reader amount. Your ever presence is enough.**           

In the letter _Some Basic Usages of Python in My Daily Work (I)_, we have known how Python could exchange information with an xlsx. file and some preliminary operations to edit data performed in Python. Based on these preliminary operations and some extended coding knowledge shown in this article, I would develop a simple and skeleton model to perform the decision-making process and obtain an elementary demand/supply match report.        
            
Yours,

## Bridge connecting the Parent Items and Son Items              
Our working calendar had three lines: the planning line, the ordering line and the implementing line. The planning line and the ordering line are the activating source of the whole operating process. In actual case, planning objects would be determined in different levels of semi-products or raw materials. Different patterns of resource planning depend on the weights of forecast data or order data to activate the operations as the source of demand, like the pull pattern 100% from forecast data and the push pattern 100% from order data.
